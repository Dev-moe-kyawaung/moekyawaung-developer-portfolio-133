    answer: 'Kotlin is my primary tongue — twelve years of casting. Coroutines are the summoning circles that let work happen without blocking the main thread, and Flow is the current of data that streams through them. Together they let the UI stay smooth while the app speaks to the network and database in the background.',

    answer: 'Jetpack Compose weaves interface from pure function calls — you describe the screen for a given state, and the framework diffs and redraws. The craft is keeping recomposition cheap: stable models, deferred reads, and hoisting state so only the smallest subtree rebuilds. Done well, a list scrolls at 60fps on a 2019 mid-ranger.',

Every mutation is queued as an idempotent operation with a client UUID so retries are safe. Conflicts resolve field-by-field with last-write-wins and server arbitration, and the merge history is kept for ninety days. In the field this took offline task completion from 48 to 97 percent.',

    answer: 'Layering is a testability decision, not a structural one. A pure domain layer lets invariants be verified in milliseconds without the framework.

    answer: 'XML was a document format forced into a view hierarchy. Compose makes UI a pure function of state — same state, same pixels.

Divergence is deep and continuous: two native codebases with shared domain logic is cheaper long term. That decision belongs in the product, not the tech stack — and it should be revisited at every major release.',
